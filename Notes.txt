#Types of Triggers
	*Before Triggers - used to update or validate record values before theyâ€™re saved to the database.
	*After Triggers - used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record's Id or LastModifiedDate field), and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.
